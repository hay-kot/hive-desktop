//   - The runner puts the app and the Vite task in process groups of their own,
//     because killing a group is how its file watcher restarts them. A terminal
//     that closes signals only the foreground group — the task shell and the
//     runner — and neither the runner nor the watcher library registers SIGHUP,
//     so the runner dies on Go's default disposition before it can tear anything
//     down. The app is left running with no dev session behind it. That leak is
//     what this exists to close.
//   - The runner only ever SIGKILLs the app. Asking it to close first is what
//     gives the dev loop the same graceful shutdown a packaged build gets.
//
// The runner is started in its own process group so terminal signals arrive
// here and nowhere below: the ordering — app first, runner second — is the
// whole point, and it is lost if the runner starts killing groups on its own
// copy of the same Ctrl+C. A close that delivers no signal at all is caught by
// terminalClosed instead, so neither half of this depends on the other.

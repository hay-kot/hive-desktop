# devserver

A development-only proxy between desktop instances and the GitHub API. It does two things:

1. **Caches GitHub responses** across every dev instance and every restart, so N worktrees share one rate-limit budget instead of each burning their own.
2. **Simulates events** — config-driven overlays rewrite what GitHub appears to say, and a webhook pusher injects payloads that never came from GitHub at all. A dashboard drives both.

Not shipped, not imported by the app, loopback-only. Design rationale: [ADR 0017](../../docs/decisions/0017-devserver-github-proxy.md).

## Quick start

```bash
mise run devserver     # starts on 127.0.0.1:7777; leave it running
mise run desktop:dev   # already routed through it
```

**Development is proxied by default.** `cmd/devtools prepare` writes the API base into this worktree's `launch.env`, so there is nothing to export and no flag to remember. Open <http://127.0.0.1:7777> for the dashboard.

**One proxy serves every worktree.** It is a singleton by design: overlay state lives in the process holding the port, so a second one would mean the dashboard you are looking at might not control the instance you are watching.

Launching devserver when one is already running is not an error — the second process **stands by**, retrying the port every `--standby-poll` (2s), and takes over the moment the live one stops. So `mise run devserver` is safe to run from anywhere without checking first, and closing whichever session happened to start the proxy does not leave the other worktrees without one. A foreign process on the port is still fatal: waiting on it would leave instances pointed at something that is not a proxy.

Nothing preflights the proxy. If it is not running, GitHub calls fail as transport errors in the desktop log, same as any other GitHub failure.

`solo up` runs both tabs from the checked-in `.solo.yml`.

### Running against real GitHub

Put this in the gitignored `overrides.env` beside `launch.env` (mise loads it second, so it wins):

```
HIVE_DESKTOP_DEVELOPMENT_GITHUB_API_BASE=""
```

An empty value means the app talks to api.github.com directly.

### What it does not do on startup

The shipped config declares **no overlays**, so starting devserver never rewrites what a connected instance sees — you get the caching proxy, which is the whole fix for the rate-limit problem, and nothing changes until you click something. A proxy that silently faked data the moment it started would make every subsequent bug suspect.

The app logs a warning at startup when the override is set, and every proxied response carries an `X-Devserver-Outcome` header (`hit`, `miss`, `revalidated`, `stale`, `passthrough`).

## Why it helps

GitHub's limits are **per token**, so concurrent dev instances share one budget. Three things make development worse than the shipped app:

- `LiveProvider`'s cache is in-memory, and `wails3 dev` restarts the Go process on every backend edit
- each worktree owns an isolated data root (ADR 0014), so two instances share no fetch results
- `ConfirmTerminal` batches every absent item into one aliased GraphQL request per 100, but the client never caches it — it fires fresh every tick

devserver also stores ETags and revalidates with `If-None-Match`. A 304 costs no primary quota, so even an expired entry is usually far cheaper than a refetch. The client itself has none of this ([#62](https://github.com/hay-kot/hive-desktop/issues/62)).

## Config

`mise run devserver` passes the checked-in `cmd/devserver/devserver.yaml`. Edit it freely — it is a development default, not a fixture.

This is the only config location. Development configuration is versioned alongside the code whose behaviour it simulates, so there is deliberately no per-user file in a home directory — invisible local state changing what a dev instance sees is the failure mode this avoids. It is also the default when `--config` is absent; an explicit `--config` that does not exist is an error rather than a silent fallback.

`listen` is the address every worktree's `launch.env` is pointed at, so changing it here moves every instance with it.

Every section is optional — the annotated shipped file is the reference.

```yaml
listen: 127.0.0.1:7777
upstream: https://api.github.com
cache:
  ttl: 5m                       # how long before revalidating

# Not set in the shipped config — anything here applies from the first request,
# before you have touched the dashboard. Add entries only to pin a state you
# want back on every restart.
overlays:
  - match: {repo: hay-kot/hive-desktop, num: 58}
    set:
      reason: approval_requested
      labels: [needs-review]

# Multi-step lifecycle sequences are not configured. They are composed and run
# at runtime through POST /_ctl/scenario — see the Control API below.

webhooks:
  # Commented out in the shipped config: the desktop's webhook port is random
  # per install, so no committed URL can be right.
  targets:
    - name: local-desktop
      url: http://127.0.0.1:24681/hooks/devserver   # from Settings ▸ Webhooks
      secret: dev-secret                            # the node's X-Hive-Secret
  payloads:
    pr-opened:
      id: devserver-pr-1
      kind: PR
      repo: acme/widgets
      title: Add retry to fetch
      url: https://github.com/acme/widgets/pull/1
      state: open
```

Overlay state is in-memory. Config seeds it; the dashboard and control API mutate it; a restart returns to exactly what the file says. A debugging session cannot leave permanent fake data behind.

Overlays, actions, and scenarios all target an item by `repo` and `num`, and only an item the proxy has already observed will exist to rewrite. Start devserver, let an instance poll once, and read the repo and number from the dashboard or `GET /_ctl/state` — that is the item list.

### Mutation fields

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | `open`, `closed`, or `merged` — drives lifecycle transitions |
| `labels` | Replaces the label set |
| `reason` | Notification reason; becomes the feed's activity summary |
| `title`, `body` | Display text |
| `draft` | Marks a PR draft |
| `absent` | Removes from search results while the batched GraphQL state lookup still answers |
| `updated_at` | Overrides the timestamp; auto-stamped to now when omitted |

`updated_at` is auto-stamped because the classifier ignores any change that does not advance it — an un-stamped mutation would be silently invisible.

## What "simulating an event" actually means

The desktop's `sources.github` reads exactly four things: `state`, `updatedAt`, `labels`, and a notification `reason`. It never fetches review state. So the action vocabulary is GitHub's own:

| Action | What the app sees |
| --- | --- |
| `review-requested` | "Review requested" |
| `approval-requested` | "Approval requested" |
| `comment` | "New comment activity" |
| `ci-activity` | "CI status changed" |
| `mention` | "Mentioned on GitHub" |
| `state-change` | "State changed on GitHub" |
| `draft` / `ready` | Draft flag |
| `merge` / `close` | Terminal transition + drops out of search |
| `reopen` | Back to open, back into search |

**There is no `approve` action.** GitHub has no such notification reason, and the app never reads review state — an approval reaches it as activity on the item. Inventing a richer vocabulary would teach a wrong model of how the app behaves.

`merge` and `close` also set `absent`, because that is how GitHub behaves once an item leaves an `is:open` query, and it is the only way to exercise the desktop's `ConfirmAbsence` path. One overlay is rendered consistently into all three response shapes the app reads — search nodes, notification entries, and the batched GraphQL state lookup — so a simulated merge cannot produce a state the real API could never return.

## Control API

The dashboard is a thin renderer over these, and an agent drives the same surface directly. All under `/_ctl/`.

```bash
# preflight: is this the build under test, and has an app connected yet?
# health reports {devserver, appConnected, requests, itemsObserved, ...};
# version reports the VCS revision + dirty flag Go stamped into the binary.
curl localhost:7777/_ctl/health
curl localhost:7777/_ctl/version

# everything live: observed items, overlays, running scenarios, targets, payloads
curl localhost:7777/_ctl/state

# quick action
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/action \
  -d '{"repo":"hay-kot/hive-desktop","num":58,"action":"merge"}'

# arbitrary mutation
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/overlay \
  -d '{"repo":"hay-kot/hive-desktop","num":58,"set":{"state":"open","labels":["wip"]}}'

# a multi-step scenario, composed inline and run in the background; each step is
# an action or a raw set, with an optional wait. Steps accumulate onto the item.
# Returns {"scenario":"scenario-1"}; watch it under scenarios in /_ctl/state.
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/scenario -d '{"steps":[
  {"repo":"hay-kot/hive-desktop","num":58,"action":"review-requested"},
  {"wait":"60s"},
  {"repo":"hay-kot/hive-desktop","num":58,"set":{"state":"merged","absent":true}}
]}'

curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/overlay/clear -d '{"repo":"hay-kot/hive-desktop","num":58}'
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/overlays/clear
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/cache/purge

# push a webhook to a configured target; overrides merge over the named payload
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/webhooks/push \
  -d '{"target":"local-desktop","payload":"pr-opened","overrides":{"state":"resolved"}}'

# or to an inline target — the only way to reach a desktop instance, whose
# webhook port is random per install. target may be a name or a {url, secret}.
curl -XPOST localhost:7777/_ctl/webhooks/push \
  -d '{"target":{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:24681/hooks/devserver","secret":"dev-secret"},
       "body":{"id":"x","title":"Inline","state":"open"}}'
```

Unknown JSON fields are rejected, so a typo in a hand-written call fails loudly instead of silently doing nothing. Inline webhook targets must be loopback.

## Webhook pusher

Targets point at a running instance's local webhook listener. Get the base URL from **Settings ▸ Webhooks** (the port is random per install — see ADR 0007) and append a `sources.webhook` node's path. The `secret` must match that node's configured secret.

A payload keyed on a stable top-level `id` updates the same inbox item on re-delivery; without one the listener hashes the body, so every push is a new item. Payloads that follow the [canonical item contract](../../docs/decisions/0008-canonical-item-contract.md) render as first-party feed rows.

## Cache location and lifetime

The cache lives at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/hive/devserver/cache.db` (`~/.cache/hive/devserver/cache.db` by default), and **survives restarts** — that is why it is SQLite rather than a map. Entries keep their fetch time, so a restart inside the TTL serves straight from disk, and one past it revalidates with `If-None-Match` for a 304 that costs no quota.

The path is deliberately independent of the desktop's data root. That root is the app's state, and ADR 0014 gives each worktree an isolated copy that `desktop:dev:reset` exists to delete — deriving the cache from it would give every worktree its own cache and discard it on reset, losing both the sharing and the persistence the cache exists for. Override with `cache.path` in config if you want it elsewhere.

Overlays, observed items, stats, and the activity log are all in-memory and reset on restart. Only responses persist. Delete the file or hit **purge cache** any time; it costs one API call per entry to rebuild.

## Scope

Three endpoints are cached: `POST /graphql`, `GET /notifications`, `GET /user`. `POST /graphql` carries two rewritten document shapes — the batched search and the batched state lookup (`repository.issueOrPullRequest`) that `ConfirmTerminal` sends — and `GET /notifications` is rewritten too; `GET /user` is cached but never rewritten. Everything else passes straight through, so a new client call keeps working without devserver knowing about it.

Only 2xx responses are cached — caching a 401 would outlive the bad token, and caching a rate-limit 403 would extend the outage past its own reset. When upstream fails and a cached copy exists, it is served stale rather than failing the instance.

The cache key includes a hash of the bearer token, so two accounts pointed at one devserver never see each other's data. The token is hashed, never stored.

The OAuth device flow is **not** proxied — `development.github.api_base` only moves the API base. Sign-in still goes to github.com.

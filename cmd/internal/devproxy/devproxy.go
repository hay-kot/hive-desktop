// Package devproxy is the contract shared by cmd/devserver and cmd/devtools:
// where the development GitHub proxy listens, and how to tell whether one is
// already running there.
//
// It exists because the proxy is a singleton by design (ADR 0017). devserver
// needs to know if it is a duplicate launch, and devtools needs to point a
// worktree's launch.env at the same address and fail loudly when nothing is
// listening. Duplicating either fact would let the two drift into a setup
// where the app is redirected at a port no proxy owns.

# Sign in to GitHub

Create a workspace during first run, then select **Connect GitHub**. Copy the displayed code, open `github.com/login/device`, and approve access.

Hive requests the `repo` and `notifications` scopes to read issues, pull requests, and GitHub notifications. It stores the token in the OS keychain.

You can also choose **Use a token instead** and provide a classic personal access token with those scopes.

If the code expires, start the connection again. Manage connected accounts later under **Settings ▸ Integrations ▸ GitHub**.

You can skip this step and connect another supported source. See [Sources](../inbox/sources.md).

# Settings

Open Settings with <kbd>⌘,</kbd> or from the command palette.

## In the app

Settings shows or changes:

- general behavior such as polling and the default editor;
- the theme, interface fonts, and terminal typography;
- terminal spacing, visible windows, and the status bar;
- keyboard shortcuts;
- notification delivery and sound;
- connected source accounts and the local webhook listener;
- actions and quick terminals;
- the agent workspace folder location;
- the optional Hive CLI compatibility config;
- diagnostics, updates, and release channels.

The app validates changes before saving them.

## Configuration files

Hive Desktop and the hive CLI use separate configuration paths. They share Code sessions and tasks when both use the same Hive data root, which is the default.

| Scope | Common default | Configures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hive CLI and Code session engine | `~/.config/hive/config.yaml` | Repositories, agent profiles, clone and recycle rules, setup commands, starting tmux windows, and shared session behavior |
| Hive Desktop | `~/.config/hive/desktop/` | Inbox, Code presentation, Chats, notifications, integrations, shortcuts, and app behavior |

The hive CLI config honors `HIVE_CONFIG` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. The Desktop config honors `HIVE_DESKTOP_CONFIG_DIR` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Restart Hive Desktop after changing the hive CLI configuration.

Session and task sharing also depends on the data root. The common default is `~/.local/share/hive/`. If you move it, point the hive CLI's `HIVE_DATA_DIR` and Hive Desktop's `HIVE_DESKTOP_HIVE_DATA_DIR` at the same directory. See the hive CLI [configuration reference](https://colonyops.github.io/hive/configuration/) and [repository rules](https://colonyops.github.io/hive/configuration/rules/).

Hive Desktop keeps these files under its config directory by default:

| Content | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Settings | `settings.yaml` |
| Flows | `flows/` |
| Actions | `actions.yml` |
| Agent workspaces | `workspaces/` |
| Application data and logs | `~/.local/share/hive/desktop/` |
| Account tokens | OS keychain |

Set `HIVE_DESKTOP_CONFIG_DIR` or `HIVE_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR` to move the config or data root. You can also move the flow, action, and workspace paths separately.

!!! tip "Ask the Hive workspace"
    The **Hive** workspace in **Chats** can update settings with the `hive-settings` skill. For example, ask it to change the polling interval or terminal font.

## Hive CLI compatibility config

Hive Desktop includes the Hive runtime it needs. A separately installed Hive CLI is not required.

If you use the Hive CLI, Desktop also reads its optional configuration file at startup. It checks `HIVE_CONFIG` first, then looks for `config.yaml`, `config.yml`, `hive.yaml`, or `hive.yml` under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hive/` with `~/.config/hive/` as the fallback. No file is required. Hive uses built-in defaults when none exists.

**Settings ▸ Hive CLI** shows the exact path selected at startup. From there you can copy the path, open or reveal an existing file, or create a missing file and open it. Restart Hive Desktop after editing the file.

To choose a default agent, set `agents.default` to a configured agent profile. `HIVE_DEFAULT_AGENT` takes precedence when it names a configured profile.

## Advanced configuration

Most users can use the Settings screens. Edit `settings.yaml` for values that are not exposed there or when you manage configuration with dotfiles.

```yaml
polling:
  interval: 5m
http:
  enabled: true
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 0
paths:
  tmux: ""
editor:
  command: ""
agent_workspaces:
  dir: ""
```

- `polling.interval` has a minimum of 60 seconds.
- The local HTTP server provides webhooks, MCP, and terminal connections. It only binds to loopback. Set a fixed port if another local tool needs a stable webhook URL.
- `paths.tmux` accepts an absolute path when Hive cannot find tmux.
- `editor.command` accepts an executable name or absolute path without arguments.
- `agent_workspaces.dir` changes where Chats workspaces are stored.

Every scalar setting can be overridden for one launch with an environment variable based on its YAML path. For example, `polling.interval` becomes `HIVE_DESKTOP_POLLING_INTERVAL`.

## Updates

**Settings ▸ About** shows the current channel and controls automatic update checks.

To follow a different channel, edit `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
updates:
  channel: beta
```

Available channels are Stable, Beta, and Dev. An omitted channel follows the channel used for the current build.

## Telemetry

**Settings ▸ Observability** shows the app's current CPU, memory, process tree, Go runtime, and UI frame behavior. Process data updates while the page is open. UI frame sampling also runs only while this page is open.

The same page reports the status of two independent Grafana Cloud exports:

- **Metrics, logs, and traces** use an OTLP endpoint.
- **Continuous profiles** use a Pyroscope-compatible Grafana Cloud Profiles endpoint.

Each card shows whether the destination is enabled and configured, plus whether it is **Exporting**, **Ready**, waiting for a restart, or failed to start. Exporting means Hive started the local exporter. Check Grafana Cloud or the Hive log for later delivery failures. A change in `settings.yaml` requires a restart.

Grafana Cloud provides different URLs and basic-auth users for OTLP and Profiles. A Cloud Access Policy token can serve both when it includes `profiles:write`, but configure each destination separately in `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-central-0.grafana.net/otlp
  instance_id: "123456"
  host_id: "fdbf79e8af94cb7f9e8df36789187052"
  token: op://Private/Grafana Cloud/otlp-token
  profiles:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://profiles-prod-us-central-0.grafana.net
    user: "123456"
    token: op://Private/Grafana Cloud/profiles-token
```

`telemetry.host_id` is optional. Set it to the machine id to add the OpenTelemetry `host.id` resource attribute to metrics, logs, and traces. Profiles use the same value as their `host_id` label. Hive does not read a machine id automatically. Each app launch gets a random OpenTelemetry `service.instance.id`. `telemetry.instance_id` has a different purpose: it is the OTLP endpoint's basic-auth username.

Profile export collects CPU, allocation, and in-use heap profiles. It does not collect goroutine, mutex, or block profiles. OTLP and profile export can run independently.

Tokens must use `env:`, `file:`, or `op://` references. Hive rejects literal telemetry tokens in the settings file. Endpoints and users may also use these references.

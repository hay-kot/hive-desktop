// into something the palette lists and a chord can reach.
//
// Only identity crosses the bridge: what a launcher runs stays in the core and
// is resolved when it is opened by id, so a stale catalog here cannot run a
// command the user has since changed. Where it may run is the core's answer
// too — `requiresSession` is what a launcher with no configured cwd reports,
// and it becomes the command's context so the palette and the keymap gate on
// the same thing the core enforces (ADR quick-terminal-launchers-are-session-scoped).

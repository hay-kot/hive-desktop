// fetched once and shared by the route guard, the command that opens the pane,
// and the pane itself.
//
// A Vite-served frontend is a development build by construction and needs no
// backend answer. Everything else asks, because the pane is reachable in a
// shipped build when development.devtools.enabled is on — which is the point:
// a dev build's memory profile is not the one that ships
// (ADR developer-tools-are-reachable-in-a-shipped-build-behind-a-setting).

// A large panel over whatever view is active, sized for TasksView's
// tree+detail split. Reuses BaseModal's mechanics (teleport, backdrop, focus
// trap, return focus) rather than BaseModal itself: its fixed pixel width and
// title-only header don't fit a toolbar'd hub view. TasksView already calls
// useEscapeToClose, so Escape is handled there and not duplicated here.
//
// This overlay must never register with useOpenModalCount (so also never
// become BaseModal-backed, which registers on mount): TasksView's Escape
// handler and App.vue's tasks.toggle exception both read a non-zero count as
// "a dialog is stacked above the overlay" and would permanently refuse to
// close it.

// don't fit a toolbar'd view. ActivityView already calls useEscapeToClose, so
// Escape is handled there and not duplicated here.
//
// This overlay must never register with useOpenModalCount (so also never become
// BaseModal-backed, which registers on mount): App.vue reads a non-zero count
// as "a dialog is stacked above the overlay", and the tasks overlay beside it
// would then permanently refuse to close.

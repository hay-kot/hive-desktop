// The seam between the global keymap and the Agents area's two-level list,
// mirroring lib/terminalTree.ts. `agents.focus-sidebar` / `agents.focus-pane`
// are dispatched by App.vue like every other bindable command, but they act on
// DOM elements that live inside AgentsMode — the workspace list and the
// session pane. A plain module registry rather than a composable: it holds no
// lifecycle of its own, so the list publishes its handles from its own mount
// hooks instead of inheriting an effect scope from whoever happens to call in.

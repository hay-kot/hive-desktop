// @wailsio/runtime's drag module starts a 50ms polling interval as an
// import-time side effect, and that interval's very first tick dereferences
// `window` (it calls window.clearInterval to stop itself). Any spec importing
// the Wails runtime — which includes anything reaching a generated service
// binding — that finishes within those 50ms leaves the timer pending, so it
// fires after Vitest has torn the happy-dom environment down and raises
// `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. That surfaces as an unhandled error
// which fails the whole run regardless of how the assertions went, and it is
// timing-dependent: fast local runs usually win the race, slower CI ones do
// not.
//
// setupFiles run before any test module is evaluated, and `window` is
// `globalThis` under this environment, so patching here catches the runtime's
// `window.setInterval` call and lets afterAll clear it while `window` is still
// alive. Intervals only: this is about a module-scope poller outliving its
// environment, not about test-owned timers.

// working localStorage, so this in-memory stand-in exists purely so tests
// exercise the same code paths (useTheme, useResizablePanel, ...) as
// production.
//
// It is installed ONCE, at setup-module load — before any test file (and its
// module-singleton `useStorage` calls, e.g. useTheme) evaluates — so those
// capture a working, stable Storage reference. beforeEach then `clear()`s that
// same instance (rather than swapping in a new one) to keep specs isolated
// without invalidating references already captured by singletons.

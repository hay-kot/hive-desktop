# Hive desktop shell

This directory is the Wails v3 Vue + TypeScript shell for Hive.

## Native shell

On macOS, the shell uses `application.MacOptions.ActivationPolicy` set to
`application.ActivationPolicyRegular`, so Hive is a regular app with a Dock
icon. It also sets `ApplicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed: false`,
keeping the application alive after its window closes.

The visible 1360×864 Hive window uses native hidden-inset titlebar chrome: a
`MacTitleBar` with `AppearsTransparent`, `HideTitle`, `FullSizeContent`,
`UseToolbar`, and `HideToolbarSeparator`, pinned to
`MacToolbarStyleUnifiedCompact` so AppKit cannot drift the toolbar height
across macOS versions, and `InvisibleTitleBarHeight: 42` so the traffic
lights center on the 42px HTML titlebar.

Closing the window hides it rather than destroying it, via a `WindowClosing`
hook registered with `RegisterHook`. It must be a hook, not `OnWindowEvent`:
hooks run synchronously before listeners, so `Cancel()` reliably aborts
Wails' internal window-destroy listener, which otherwise races the callback
in a separate goroutine. The app keeps running; reopen the window from the
Dock (`ApplicationShouldHandleReopen` calls `Show`) or from the tray menu.

The tray is a template icon with a dynamic menu: **Show Hive** calls
`window.Show()` and `window.Focus()`, profile checkboxes toggle whether each
flow polls and runs, and **Quit** calls `app.Quit()`. Invalid flow files remain
visible as disabled menu items. The menu is rebuilt after flow changes so
external YAML edits and in-app toggles stay synchronized. In the pinned Wails
alpha, `SystemTray.SetTemplateIcon` accepts exactly one `[]byte` PNG, so the
shell embeds only the retina `tray-templateTemplate@2x.png`; the 1x PNG is
still generated and committed as an asset but not embedded.

Manual native-shell verification remains required: check the Dock icon,
native traffic lights centered on the 42px titlebar, close-hides-window,
reopening from the Dock and from the tray menu, profile checkbox toggles and
live menu refresh, template-icon tinting in light and dark menu bars, and Quit
from the tray menu.

## Pinned versions

- Wails CLI and Go module: `github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3 v3.0.0-alpha2.116`
- npm runtime: `@wailsio/runtime 3.0.0-alpha.97`

`3.0.0-alpha.97` is the runtime version bundled by the pinned Wails Go module.
The `vue-ts` template alias was not available in alpha2.116; `wails3 init -t
vue -n hive-desktop` is that release's Vue + TypeScript template.

From the repository root, `mise install` provisions the matching Wails CLI.
The manual equivalent is:

```sh
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0-alpha2.116
```

## Parent-module adaptations

The generated template normally has its own `go.mod`. Hive is a single Go
module, so `desktop/go.mod` and `desktop/go.sum` were removed. The desktop
entry point is the `github.com/colonyops/hive/desktop` package within the root
`github.com/colonyops/hive` module, and the Wails dependency is required by the
root `go.mod`.

The Wails Taskfiles still run from `desktop/`, which lets Go discover the
parent module automatically. Their `go:mod:tidy` task explicitly runs from the
module root, and their module-file task inputs point at `../go.mod` and
`../go.sum`. The Android and iOS binding-generation task inputs use those same
parent paths. The template's unused iOS option-overlay stubs were removed;
they were subdirectory files rather than code compiled with the desktop package.

A `main` package named `desktop` cannot use an unqualified `go build
./desktop` output at the repository root: Go would try to write a `desktop`
binary where this directory already exists. Always give the desktop binary an
explicit output path:

```sh
go build -o ./desktop/bin/hive-desktop ./desktop
go build -tags server -o ./desktop/bin/hive-desktop-server ./desktop
```

`frontend/dist/.gitkeep` is tracked and embedded by `//go:embed
all:frontend/dist`, so the first command also compiles before a frontend build.
`frontend/public/.gitkeep` is copied by Vite so the tracked dist placeholder is
restored after every frontend build. The rest of `frontend/dist` remains ignored.

Bindings must be generated while the current directory is `desktop/`, so the
Wails CLI identifies that directory as the application package while Go walks
up to the parent module:

```sh
cd desktop
wails3 generate bindings -clean=true -ts -i
```

The frontend Vite plugin requires generated typed-event bindings. The shell
registers the `auth:updated`, `log:appended`, `flows:updated`, and
`actions:updated` events using package-variable initialization rather than an
`init()` function because this repository enables `gochecknoinits` (main.go
carries a comment saying the same). All are wake-up signals: `auth:updated`
makes the frontend re-read auth Status (device-flow grants land in a Go
goroutine), `log:appended` carries the pipeline event log's new tail offset,
`flows:updated` fires after a flows/*.yaml reload, and `actions:updated` fires
after an actions.yml reload so the detail pane can re-read configured actions.

The GitHub fetch layer lives in `internal/desktop/feed`: mock fixtures in
`HIVE_DESKTOP_MOCK` modes, or the GitHub-backed `LiveProvider`. Live data is
acquired per embedded flow **source** (a search query or the notifications
inbox) and cached by what is requested — kind + query + limit — so any number
of source nodes reading the same data share one request. The pipeline producer
polls every enabled flow's `github-source` nodes, appends changed items to the
event log, and commits terminal `feed` nodes into durable `feed_item` rows that
the sidebar reads.

## Flows, feeds, and actions as code

A profile is a flow. Flow definitions live as user-editable YAML under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hive/desktop/flows/` (`~/.config` fallback;
`HIVE_DESKTOP_FLOWS` overrides the directory), deliberately in the config dir
so they can live in a dotfiles repo. App-local state (`feed_item`, read state,
event-log offsets, queued output commands) stays in the data dir's `desktop/`
subdirectory.

The **System** settings screen (gear → System) surfaces these locations — the
data directory, config directory, log file (`<data-dir>/desktop/desktop.log`),
and pipeline database (`<data-dir>/desktop/desktop-pipeline.db`) — each with
copy-path, open-in-default-app, and reveal-in-file-manager actions. It can also
point the data and config directories at a different folder (e.g. an
iCloud-synced directory): the choice is written to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hive/desktop/bootstrap.yaml` and seeds `HIVE_DATA_DIR` /
`HIVE_DESKTOP_CONFIG` at the next launch, so an explicit env var still wins.
Overrides are point-only — existing data is not moved — and take effect after a
restart.

```yaml
name: Triage
enabled: true
nodes:
  - id: my-work
    type: github-source
    kind: search
    query: "is:open involves:@me archived:false"
    limit: 50
  - id: team-feed
    type: feed
wires:
  - { from: my-work, to: team-feed }
```

Flow parsing is strict and validated by Go on Deploy: node ids are unique,
known node types decode their own config, source limits match the GitHub API
caps, action nodes reference actions that exist in `actions.yml`, and wires
connect valid ports. A `flow.FlowsWatcher` watches the directory (not
individual files, so atomic editor saves work) and hot-reloads external edits;
the app's own SaveFlow/SaveLayout writes intentionally trigger the same reload
and `flows:updated` wake-up.

`actions.yml` lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hive/desktop/actions.yml`
(`HIVE_DESKTOP_ACTIONS` overrides the file) and defines detail-pane/output
worker actions such as `launch-session`, `shell`, and `publish-message`:

```yaml
version: 1
actions:
  - id: review-pr
    label: Spawn review agent
    type: launch-session
    applies_to: [pr]
    prompt_template: "Review {{ .Payload.title }}"
```

An `actions.ActionsWatcher` watches the `actions.yml` parent directory,
debounces write/rename bursts, reloads `ActionStore`, and emits
`actions:updated`. `ActionStore` keeps the last-good action set when a broken
file is saved, so a half-edited config does not blank actions out from under a
running flow or the detail pane.

Desktop-only Go code lives under `internal/desktop/**`; the `desktop/`
package is thin Wails wiring. `internal/desktop/auth` implements GitHub
authentication behind the auth service: an OAuth device flow plus a
personal-access-token fallback, with tokens stored in the OS keychain
(`HIVE_GITHUB_TOKEN` is a read-only headless override). The device flow uses
the registered Hive Desktop OAuth app's public client ID by default;
`HIVE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` overrides it, e.g. to test another registration.
`internal/github` is the shared GitHub REST client (deliberately not under
`internal/desktop`).

`HIVE_DESKTOP_MOCK` selects deterministic offline backends: `feed` starts
authenticated, `onboarding` starts signed out with a fake device flow that
grants after ~1.5s. Unset, the live backends run.

`build/config.yml` keeps `dev_mode.root_path: .`; when `wails3 dev` is started
from `desktop/`, Wails watches `desktop/` rather than the whole repository.

## Development and builds

Use the root mise tasks as the canonical entry points:

```sh
mise run desktop:generate # Regenerate frontend TS bindings.
mise run desktop:icons    # Regenerate committed icon assets.
mise run desktop:build    # Build the desktop app; on macOS emits desktop/bin/hive-desktop.
mise run desktop:serve    # Build and run the headless server build.
mise run desktop:dev      # Start Wails development mode.
```

`desktop:dev` runs `wails3 dev -config ./build/config.yml` from the desktop
application directory. The equivalent Taskfile command is `wails3 task dev`.

The alpha supports server builds. `desktop:serve` builds the frontend, then
compiles the pure HTTP-server variant without GUI dependencies to
`desktop/bin/hive-desktop-server` and runs it. The assets are `//go:embed`ded,
so frontend edits require re-running the task; the fast frontend loop is
`desktop:dev` with Vite HMR. The server defaults to `localhost:8080`; if that
port is taken, override it with the Wails-native `WAILS_SERVER_PORT` env var
(e.g. `WAILS_SERVER_PORT=9000 mise run desktop:serve`).

## Icons

The desktop icon masters live in `build/icons/`: `hive-mark.svg` is the
1024px amber Hive mark on its dark rounded-square field, and
`tray-template.svg` is the separate black-only 18px macOS template mark.
Regenerate every committed desktop icon with `mise run desktop:icons`.

The script requires librsvg (`rsvg-convert`), ImageMagick (`magick`), and
macOS `iconutil`; install the first two with `brew install librsvg imagemagick`.
The authoring toolchain was `rsvg-convert 2.62.3` and ImageMagick
`7.1.2-27`; inspect local versions with `rsvg-convert --version` and
`magick --version`. It strips volatile PNG metadata. Output is byte-stable when
regenerated on this authoring toolchain, but that guarantee does not extend to
other renderer or ImageMagick versions.

`build/darwin/icons.icns` is copied directly into macOS bundles; the Wails
scaffold's `appicon.icon` and `Assets.car` inputs were removed, so the template
icon generator is not part of any desktop build. `CFBundleIconFile` continues
to point at `icons.icns`. The Linux AppImage consumes the 512px
`build/appicon.png`; nFPM consumes the generated
`build/linux/icon-128.png` for its 128px hicolor installation path. The build
targets are macOS and Linux only, so no Windows assets are generated. The
generated `tray-templateTemplate.png` and `tray-templateTemplate@2x.png`
retain the macOS `Template` suffix for automatic tinting.

## Agent-driven UI verification

Use the headless server build for the UI verification loop:

```sh
mise run desktop:serve
```

Drive and inspect the app at `http://localhost:8080` with Playwright or browser
tooling, read the screenshots in `desktop/e2e/screenshots`, edit, and repeat.
Set `HIVE_DESKTOP_MOCK=onboarding` to drive the first-run screen offline.
Run `mise run desktop:e2e` as the Docker-only regression gate. Its harness
builds the server and starts private feed, onboarding, pipeline, and action
smoke instances inside the pinned Playwright image; no local browser install
or host Playwright invocation is supported.

Native shell behavior — the tray, the Dock, and close-hides-window — remains
a manual verification concern.

## Actions catalog and delivery

Desktop actions are global configuration, stored in `actions.yml` beside the
flow directory (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hive/desktop/actions.yml`; override with
`HIVE_DESKTOP_ACTIONS`). The settings screen creates, edits, and deletes the
catalog entries. External YAML edits reload live; a parse failure keeps the
last-good catalog until the file is fixed. `show_in_detail` controls manual
feed-item visibility only, while a flow `action` node may target any catalog
id regardless of its detail kind scope.

A flow action node is automation control: it emits a durable, deduplicated
`output_command`, not an editor-side script. `launch-session` can launch
headlessly when its repository template is configured, or interactively ask
for repository/name/agent when it is not. Prefer local HTTPS or SSH remotes
for repository templates. `shell` captures bounded stdout/stderr diagnostics.
`publish-message` accepts only a constant topic and durably publishes with
sender `hive-desktop` and an empty session identity. Completed outcomes are
typed (session or message); failed outcomes retain their persisted diagnostics.

## Docker E2E gate

`mise run desktop:e2e` is Docker-only. It builds the digest-pinned
Go/Playwright image in `desktop/e2e/Dockerfile` and runs Playwright there; it
never attaches to a host browser or server. `run-docker.sh` supplies a fresh
256-bit harness marker, which both the image command and server launcher
require, so direct host Playwright cannot start the servers. Each server has a
private data/config root. Fixture-driven servers receive private flow/action
copies and a run id; onboarding deliberately receives no injected fixture env,
and action-seed deliberately starts without an action fixture to verify exact
first-run seeding. Action smoke also gets a local bare Git remote. This keeps
parallel browser projects from mutating checked-in fixtures or sharing
SQLite/action state. Docker must be available; there is no host fallback.

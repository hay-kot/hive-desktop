# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build/build-linux-docker.sh [--arch=amd64|arm64] [--image-only]
#
# Exists so a non-Linux host (or a Linux host targeting the other architecture)
# can produce a release Linux binary: it runs the same `wails3 task
# linux:build` a native Linux host would, in an image mirroring ubuntu-24.04.
#
# Output: desktop/bin/hive-desktop, owned by the invoking user.

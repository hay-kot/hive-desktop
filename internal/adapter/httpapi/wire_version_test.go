// TestWireVersionsMatchTheFrontendConstants is the bijection between each
// socket's server-side version and the one its only client sends. Nothing else
// catches the drift: a version the server moved and the client did not is a 400
// at the handshake, which the frontend reports as a connection that dropped —
// the terminal opens over HTTP and then never streams. Every Go test dials with
// the Go constant, so the suites stay green while the app is broken.
//
// The two wires are versioned apart on purpose, and this is also what holds
// them apart: they carry different frames, so a change to one must not refuse
// the other's handshake.

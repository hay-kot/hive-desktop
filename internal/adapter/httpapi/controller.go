// Package httpapi is the HTTP adapter over app.App, mounted on the webhook
// listener's loopback server, which also hosts the optional pprof handler
// (ADR pprof-debug-endpoint).
//
// It serves two unrelated things, and the split is the point:
//
// The terminal, pop-up terminal and agent-workspace control planes under
// /api/terminal/ are the Wails frontend's own transport, not an agent surface.
// They authenticate with a per-run bearer token because each of them spawns a
// process (ADR terminal-transport, ADR a-workspace-declares-its-own-authority), and their data planes are raw WebSocket mounts
// outside the operations table.
//
// /api/status and /api/version are the liveness probe — the plain-GET way to
// ask whether the app is up and which build it is, which a shell script or a
// health check needs and JSON-RPC is the wrong shape for. Beside them sits the
// one call a chat makes about itself, POST /api/sessions/end, guarded by the
// token its own launch handed it rather than the frontend's
// (ADR a-scheduled-chat-ends-itself-through-a-capability-token-its-launch-handed-it).
//
// What is *not* here any more is the agent-facing control surface this package
// began as (ADR agent-http-api, ADR self-describing-agent-api). Inbox, feeds, profiles, actions, source
// refresh and flow dry runs are tools on the MCP server now
// (internal/adapter/mcpsrv, ADR mcp-replaces-the-agent-facing-http-api), and so is the self-description the
// OpenAPI document used to provide.

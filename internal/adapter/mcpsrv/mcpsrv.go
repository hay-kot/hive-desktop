// Package mcpsrv is the agent-facing MCP adapter over app.App: the desktop's
// capabilities as MCP tools, served over Streamable HTTP on the same loopback
// server that hosts the webhook listener (ADR agent-http-api). It replaces the REST
// control surface that preceded it — an agent discovers what the app can do
// through tools/list rather than an OpenAPI document (ADR mcp-replaces-the-agent-facing-http-api).
//
// Two properties are load-bearing:
//
// The server is stateless, so every request carries its own short-lived
// session. Nothing here holds a client between calls, which is what lets the
// adapter join no lifecycle at all: there are no long-lived SSE streams for
// App.Close to unwind, and the shutdown hazard ADR terminal-transport records for the
// terminal WebSocket does not arise.
//
// The tool set is reads and safe mutations only. Anything that spawns a
// process — terminal and agent-workspace session control — stays on httpapi's
// token-guarded terminal prefix, which is why this surface can keep the
// unauthenticated-behind-loopback posture the REST API had (ADR terminal-transport,
// ADR a-workspace-declares-its-own-authority).

// noInput is the input type of a tool that takes no arguments. The SDK

// The two ends of the surface-wide `detail` ladder.
//
// Every tool whose answer carries source-supplied JSON — an inbox item's
// payload, an event's detail, a dry run's messages — is a tool whose response
// size is set by data nobody here chose. One PR body is kilobytes, and a
// listing repeats it per item while a dry run repeats it per node, so the
// tool that answers happily in a test blows a client's limit against real
// data. Rather than a cap that silently truncates, each such tool takes a
// `detail` argument and reports the level it answered at, so an omitted field
// is never mistaken for an absent one.
//
// Individual tools may add rungs between these (see detailEmitted); summary
// and full mean the same thing everywhere.
const (
	// detailSummary omits every source-supplied payload. What remains is this
	// app's own vocabulary — ids, counters, states, timestamps — which is
	// bounded by the schema rather than by the source.
	detailSummary = "summary"
	// detailFull holds nothing back.
	detailFull = "full"
)

// register declares every tool this adapter serves.
//
// This is the tool table: the one place a tool is declared, carrying metadata
// and nothing else. Dispatch is the handler's, and every handler is a thin
// call into *app.App — the same rule httpapi's operations table follows, and
// the reason a registry used for enumeration never carries dispatch.
//
// Input schemas are inferred from each handler's typed input struct, so a tool
// cannot advertise a field its handler does not accept. Descriptions are
// written for a model rather than for a person reading a reference: what the
// tool answers, what it will not do, and what a surprising answer means.

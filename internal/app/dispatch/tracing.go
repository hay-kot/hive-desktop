// A dispatched action is a trigger, so Dispatcher.Execute roots one span per
// run and every executor below it opens a conditional child for the one thing
// it waits on. A child carries the name actions.yml uses for it, so a span
// name needs no translation back to the file that produced it. The clipboard
// executor has no child at all: it renders text and waits on nothing outside
// this process
// (ADR a-span-is-a-trigger-or-a-wait-and-its-count-per-trigger-is-bounded-by-configuration).
//
// Span attributes, not metric labels, which is why an unbounded action id,
// item key and repository are safe here.

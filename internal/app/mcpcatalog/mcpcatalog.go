// Package mcpcatalog is the shipped MCP server catalogue: the vocabulary one
// entry is declared in (Stability, Transport, Server, Descriptor) and the
// registry that holds every entry.
//
// It follows the source connector precedent (connector.Descriptor,
// internal/app/sources/connector) but carries no config factory: a shipped
// entry has no per-workspace configuration in M1, so there is nothing for a
// factory to construct. It is deliberately a leaf — a workspace names an MCP
// only by its Type string (agentws.Workspace.MCPs []string), so this package
// must never import agentws back.

// ENUM(experimental, beta, stable)
type Stability string

// Transport is how a client reaches an MCP server. It is the discriminator
// .mcp.json carries.
//
// ENUM(stdio, http, sse)
type Transport string

// Server is one MCP server's resolved launch declaration — the exact thing
// the catalogue shows a user before anything is enabled (spec §7.3) and the
// exact thing the generator writes into .mcp.json.

	// here — the loopback port is allocated at startup, so no static value
	// could be right. Server.URL is empty in the registry for such an entry
	// and is filled in before a workspace or the UI ever sees it; an entry
	// whose URL cannot be resolved reports that as a Problem rather than
	// rendering a URL that does not answer.

// Package credentials stores provider secrets keyed by Ref{Provider,
// Account}. Values live in the OS keychain; the refs themselves live in a
// separate index, because keychains cannot enumerate.
//
// It is deliberately a leaf: no dependency on app, flow, or any connector, so
// a connector package can import it without a cycle — the same rule that put
// the connector vocabulary in internal/app/sources/connector.
//
// Two rules govern everything here. **Config holds refs, never tokens**:
// flows/ is dotfiles-managed, so a token embedded in a node's config is a
// token in a git repo. And **the keychain is the truth, the index is a
// cache**: a ref present in the index whose keychain entry is gone reads as
// absent and is pruned, because the alternative is a "Connected" badge over a
// credential that no longer exists.

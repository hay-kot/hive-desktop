// starterSeed is the graph a freshly seeded workspace begins with: a few
// sources.github nodes each wired to its own feed terminal, laid out in two
// columns (sources left, feeds right), plus a notifying "Review requests" feed
// behind a filter on the notifications source.
//
// That last feed ships on by default deliberately: "tell me when I'm asked to
// review something" is the case a quiet feed cannot serve — the item sits
// unread until you happen to look — and it should not require hand-authoring a
// flow to get.
//
// It lives here rather than in flow because it names a connector, and flow is
// connector-neutral: a flow's graph is built by whoever knows which connectors
// exist, which is this package.
//
// credential is the account the source nodes fetch as, as "github/<login>".

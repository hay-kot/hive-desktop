package events

// The complete core event vocabulary. A payload carries what happened, not a
// hint that something did: an adapter that only needs a wake-up can throw the
// payload away, but one that needs the delta cannot invent it.
//
// window:focus and window:blur are deliberately absent. Window focus is
// GUI-only state and stays entirely inside the wailsui adapter.

// LogAppended reports that a producer tick or webhook delivery appended at
// least one row to the event log.
type LogAppended struct{ NextOffset int64 }

// InboxUpdated reports that the flow engine committed at least one run — feed
// membership, queued actions, or node-run metrics may all have changed.
//
// This is a distinct event from LogAppended, not a duplicate of it. The log
// growing says a source observed something; it says nothing about whether any
// flow routed it anywhere. A reader that refreshes on LogAppended reads before
// the engine has committed, and one that never sees this event misses a
// membership change a replay made with no new log rows at all.
type InboxUpdated struct{}

// ActivityAppended reports a new row in the user-facing activity log.
type ActivityAppended struct{ ID int64 }

// JobsUpdated reports a job lifecycle transition. JobID is the concrete
// demonstration of the rule: the wiring this replaces threw the id away at the
// emit boundary, so no consumer could act on which job changed. There is no
// Status field: jobs.Store's Emit hook only ever hands back the id, so a
// status here would be unpopulated at the one publish site and discarded at
// the one subscriber -- carrying it would be a promise this event cannot
// keep until something upstream hands the status over.
type JobsUpdated struct {
	JobID int64
}

// FlowsUpdated reports that the flow set was reloaded. Reason names what
// caused it — an external edit, or the app's own save.
type FlowsUpdated struct{ Reason string }

// ActionsUpdated reports that the actions catalog was reloaded or mutated.
type ActionsUpdated struct{ Count int }

// AgentWorkspacesUpdated reports that the workspace set was reloaded.
type AgentWorkspacesUpdated struct{ Count int }

// CanvasUpdated reports that a canvas in the authoring session's workspace
// changed — a block was put or removed, a canvas deleted or cleared. The
// content is stored state a reader re-reads; the payload names no canvas,
// only the session, and the pane re-reads its workspace's canvases.
type CanvasUpdated struct{ Session int64 }

// CanvasToggleRequested reports an agent asked to open or close the canvas
// pane beside its chat. Unlike the wake-up events the payload is the whole
// message — pane visibility is UI intent, not stored state to re-read. Name
// pins one canvas when opening; empty leaves the pane's own pick.
type CanvasToggleRequested struct {
	Session int64
	Name    string
	Open    bool
}

// SchedulesUpdated reports that a workspace's scheduled chats changed: a
// schedule was saved or deleted, or one of them ran. Workspace names which, so
// a pane showing another workspace can ignore it; what changed is not in the
// payload because both halves of a schedule's state (the manifest entry and
// its run history) are stored state a reader re-reads.
type SchedulesUpdated struct{ Workspace string }

// ConnectionUpdated reports that one provider's stored credentials changed —
// connected, rotated, or disconnected. Provider names which ("github"), so a
// consumer can ignore a provider it does not use; the new state is not in the
// payload because the connector's own status is the authority on it.
type ConnectionUpdated struct{ Provider string }

// NotificationRaised reports that a flow's notify terminal delivered a
// notification. Only a successful delivery is reported -- dispatch retries a
// failed one rather than treating it as having fired, so publishing early
// would announce something the user never saw. InApp carries the delivery
// policy's routing decision: wailsui uses it to decide whether to also raise
// an in-app toast, since an OS banner already went out through the notifier
// port itself by the time this publishes.
type NotificationRaised struct {
	ProfileID string
	ItemID    int64
	Title     string
	Body      string
	Severity  string
	InApp     bool

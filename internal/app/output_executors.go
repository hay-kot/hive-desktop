// outputExecutors builds the dispatch executor map: one Executor per action
// type the output worker can run. It is a function of its dependencies
// rather than a method so TestOutputExecutorsCoverEveryActionType can hold it
// against actions.Types() without standing up an App — the same split
// buildSources/sourceFactories uses for the connector registry.
//
// The map is not a mirror of the actions.yml catalog: dispatch.ActionTypeNotify
// is the flow notify terminal's own action type. A notify node's config lives
// in its flow, not in actions.yml, so it has no registry entry in package
// actions and never will — FlowNotifyActions resolves it from the live flow
// set instead (see buildOutputWorker). The invariant the test holds is
// therefore coverage of actions.Types(), not set equality with this map's
// keys.
//
// "shell" and "publish-message" stay as literals: package actions has no
// exported name for them, only the registry key Types() derives from.

// Package canonical is the item contract a connector uses when its payload is
// the canonical item shape itself (docs/decisions/0008) rather than a
// provider's own: the top-level `state` vocabulary, the classifier that maps it
// to lifecycle, and the rewrite an authoritative snapshot mints for an item
// that left it.
//
// It exists so a user learns one contract. A webhook delivery and an exec
// source's snapshot item are both JSON the user shaped themselves, so the same
// `state: resolved` must mean the same thing in both; a per-connector copy of
// these rules would drift silently, one connector archiving on a word another
// ignores.
//
// A leaf, for the same reason connector is: the connectors that share it must
// not import each other.

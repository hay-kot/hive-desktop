// Package sources is the source connector registry: the one place every
// connector type is declared, and the lookups the rest of the app resolves a
// connector through.
//
// It holds only declarations. A Descriptor is static data — type, title,
// mode, stability, capabilities, and a config factory — so this package can
// be imported by anything that needs to know a connector *exists*, including
// the flow package, which derives a node type from each entry. Constructing a
// running connector needs dependencies (the GitHub fetcher) and goes through
// connector.Factory, wired where those dependencies live.
//
// That split is also what keeps the import graph acyclic: this package
// imports the connector packages, so they must not import it. They name their
// vocabulary from internal/app/sources/connector instead.

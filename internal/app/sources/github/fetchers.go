// Fetchers hands out one feed.LiveProvider per credential, constructing them
// on first use.
//
// A LiveProvider is already a per-account object even though it was written
// as a singleton: its response cache and conditional-request state hold one
// account's items, and its rate-limit cooldown "pauses all fetches for the
// current token". Sharing one across accounts would serve one account's items
// to another and let one account's rate limit stall every other. So accounts
// get one each, and the shared thing is this registry.
//
// Providers are never evicted. The set is bounded by the number of connected
// accounts, and a disconnected account's provider holds only a response cache
// that its next resolve would miss anyway.

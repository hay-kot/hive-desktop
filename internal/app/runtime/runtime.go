// Package runtime is the flow engine: it executes one flow over one batch of
// event-log messages and produces the CommitBatch that batch is worth.
//
// It runs in Go, in-process, and it is the whole of graph execution —
// topological order, port routing, filter matching, script evaluation,
// terminal sink tagging and node-run accounting. Nothing about it is
// transport-specific, which is the point: the editor preview, a CLI dry-run
// and an MCP tool all reach the same execution rather than the desktop window
// owning one of them.
//
// The engine never writes the database and never opens its own connection.
// Run takes the messages it is given, reads durable node KV only through the
// KVReader port the caller supplies, and returns what should be committed —
// including buffered KV writes — for the caller to apply. That keeps a
// dry-run (no-op reader, discarded batch) and a live tick the same code
// path, differing only in what the ports are wired to.

// behavior is what a node type does when a message reaches it. Exactly one of
// the three fields is set.
//
// This is the runtime half of the node-type declaration whose config half is
// flow.registry: adding a node type is one line here and one line there, and
// Run never branches on a type string. A behavior with none of the three set
// is a node the engine does not know how to execute, which Run reports rather
// than silently dropping.
type behavior struct {
	// relay marks a node the core ingests for. The producer and the webhook
	// listener append its observations to the event log, so at run time it
	// only passes what was routed to it on to its wires.
	relay bool
	// sinks derives the committed side effects one message reaching this
	// terminal produces. Terminals have no outputs, so this is where a
	// message's journey ends.
	sinks func(flowID, nodeID string, cfg flow.NodeConfig, msg store.Msg) []store.Output
	// processor builds this node's per-instance transformer. It is called once
	// per node when a Runner is built.
	processor func(r *Runner, nodeID string, cfg flow.NodeConfig) (processor, error)
	// snapshotReconciled marks a node whose committed sink output is
	// membership in a set that a source snapshot restates wholesale — a
	// feed. Run declares one reconciliation scope per (node, source) so the
	// commit can drop rows the latest snapshot no longer includes, even when
	// the snapshot is empty, and the engine derives a flow's feed ids from
	// the same flag to know what replay must recompute membership for and,
	// on disable, must remove. It is meaningless on a behavior with no sinks.
	snapshotReconciled bool
	// kvCapable marks a node that owns durable node KV. The engine derives
	// the ids ActivateReplay retains from this flag; a node type missing it
	// has its rows reconciled away on the next activation.

// (or one whose ports are all empty) discards the message.

	// the "terminate, respawn" the browser gave a wedged worker.

// behaviors is the runtime registry, keyed by the same type strings
// flow.registry uses.

// Source types are not listed: a source is a relay by definition — the core
// ingests for it, so at run time it only forwards what was routed to it — and
// deriving them from the connector registry is what keeps adding a connector
// a change to internal/app/sources alone.

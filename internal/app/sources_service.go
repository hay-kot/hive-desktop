// SourcesService is ingestion on demand: a producer tick someone asked for
// rather than the next one settings.polling.interval would have run. Both
// entry points force the tick, so a source that declared an hourly cadence
// still runs.
//
// They differ in what happens to the fetch caches. A user pressing refresh is
// asserting that something upstream changed, so Refresh drops the caches and
// pays for the refetch. A flow edit asserts nothing about upstream — an added
// or retyped source node has nothing cached under its query anyway — so Run
// keeps them and stays cheap enough to fire on every deploy.

// TestOutputExecutorsCoverEveryActionType is the dispatch side of the

// registered actions.yml catalog) must have an Executor in the map the
// output worker dispatches through, or a configured action of that type
// would silently go unexecuted.
//
// The reverse is not asserted: the map also carries dispatch.ActionTypeNotify,
// the flow notify terminal's own action type, which has no actions.Types()
// entry — see outputExecutors' doc comment. Coverage of the catalog is the
// invariant here, not set equality with the map's keys.

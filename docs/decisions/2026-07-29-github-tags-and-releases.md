# Publish GitHub tags and Releases as the source-side record of a desktop release

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-29

## Context

Distribution runs entirely through R2 and channel manifests ([r2-manifest-distribution](2026-07-23-r2-manifest-distribution.md)): the app never reads GitHub, and the repo is private so it cannot serve public downloads. 0003 left the `desktop-v*` tag as the "source-side version anchor and changelog record," but the flow never delivered on the changelog half — the publisher created no tag, the runbook created a lightweight tag locally and told the operator not to push it, and no GitHub Release existed. So there was no per-version changelog anywhere, and the in-app "release notes" link (`wailsui.ReleaseURL`, which points at `releases/tag/desktop-v<version>`) resolved to nothing.

## Decision

A successful `cmd/release publish` records the release on GitHub as its final step, after the artifacts are uploaded and verified.

- **Push the tag, don't hand-tag.** The publisher creates the lightweight `desktop-v<version>` tag at the release commit and pushes it to origin. The manual `git tag` step is gone. The tag stays lightweight (the GitHub Release, not the tag, holds the notes) and keeps the existing namespace.
- **A GitHub Release per version, notes generated from the git range.** `gh release create --generate-notes --notes-start-tag <previous desktop tag>` produces the PR/commit changelog since the previous desktop tag; a short header prepended via `--notes` states that downloads come from R2 and links the `releases/<version>/` prefix and `SHA256SUMS`. The previous tag is the greatest `desktop-v*` below this version **that is present on origin**, so the boundary is correct once tags are pushed and degrades to GitHub's own baseline for the bootstrap release whose predecessor was never pushed.
- **dev and beta are prereleases; stable is Latest.** The channel drives `--prerelease --latest=false` for dev and beta, so a dev build never sits above a shipped stable on the releases page.
- **No artifacts attached.** The Release carries notes only; R2 remains the sole artifact store (0003). The repo being private makes GitHub-hosted downloads a non-option anyway, but this holds regardless.
- **Last step, and independently recoverable.** The GitHub work runs after the irreversible R2 upload and verification, and is exposed as its own idempotent `release github <version>` subcommand. If it fails after the upload (a `gh` outage), the R2 release is already live and re-running `publish` would hit the immutability guard — so the recovery path re-records only the GitHub side. `gh` authentication is checked in `publish` preflight so a missing login aborts before any build.
- **Idempotent and conflict-aware.** A tag or Release already at the release commit is left untouched; a tag on origin pointing at a different commit is a hard error. `prepare` still rejects a pre-existing tag up front, so the conflict path is the recovery-run backstop, not the normal case.

## Consequences

- Every published version now has a changelog on GitHub, and the in-app release-notes link resolves to it.
- A release now needs an authenticated `gh` in addition to macOS and Docker; a local `--skip-upload` build records nothing on GitHub.
- Tags are pushed from now on; the two pre-existing unpushed tags stay local and un-released, which is why the previous-tag lookup tolerates a missing origin tag instead of assuming every predecessor is on origin.
- The Release is cosmetic to distribution — nothing reads it — so a failed or skipped GitHub step never affects what users download, only the changelog record.
